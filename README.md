Alcohol Sales Analysis – Retail & Warehouse
Description

This project analyzes alcohol sales data to help a company optimize shelf space and inventory during an economically challenging period. Using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint, the analysis identifies top sellers and highlights low-performing products that may no longer justify valuable shelf space.

Tools Used

SQL – Data extraction, cleaning, and querying

Excel – Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visual insights

PowerPoint – Final presentation of findings and recommendations

Project Overview

Due to financial pressure and workforce shortages, the company needed to downsize and strategically reassess which alcohol products to continue stocking. Shelf space directly impacts profit, making it crucial to focus on high-performing items.

This project covers both the retail and warehouse sides of sales, identifying:

Products driving the most revenue

Underperforming items are taking up shelf space

Trends in customer purchasing behavior

Areas where inventory can be streamlined without harming sales

Data

The dataset included retail and warehouse sales records, item descriptions, product types, and sales volumes. Data was cleaned and standardized using Excel and SQL before being analyzed in Power BI.

Methodology

SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and segment sales data

Excel cleanup for missing values, inconsistent naming, and formatting

Power BI dashboards to identify trends and rank product performance

PowerPoint presentation summarizing insights for stakeholders
